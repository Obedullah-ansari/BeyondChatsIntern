## 🎯 Objective

The goal was to **replicate the UI of Fin** as accurately as possible using the provided reference video. To refine the replica, I also reviewed the official **Intercom** website to observe Fin's layout, styling, and functionality.

Dummy responses are powered by **Gemini AI**, acting like Fin to simulate realistic interactions.
